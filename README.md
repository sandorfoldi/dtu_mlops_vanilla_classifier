<p><small>Project based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">cookiecutter data science project template</a>. #cookiecutterdatascience</small></p>

This project in its current form aims at 
training a vanilla fully connected network 
to learn classification on a corrupted mnist dataset.

First, src/data/make_dataset.py should be run 
to generate the processed dataset,
which consists of four tensors corrseponding to 
train_imgs, train_labels, test_imgs, test_labels saved
with pt extension.

Then, src/models/train_model.py should be run.

At this point, we have a trained model, which can be evaluated with
src/models/predict_model.py

Visualizations can be generated with the scripts in src/visualization.
